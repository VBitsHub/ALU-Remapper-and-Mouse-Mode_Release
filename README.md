# ALU-Remapper-and-Mouse-Mode

This file was created to be used with the AtGames Legends Ultimate in USB OTG mode with CoinOPs / RetroFE. Currently the following the configurations for ALU control mapping are available for CoinOPs menu, MaMe, Cemu, DEmul, DolphinX, FuturePinball, mednafen, N64, Pinballfx 3, redream, RetroArch,RetroArchSNES, Rpcs3, Samsung Gamboy, Sega Model 2 Emulator v1.1a, Sega Model 3, Sony Playstation 2, and Teknoparrot. Also include are MaMe custom profiles for using Trackball for games that use it as well as TOP down games for P1. Spinner games are supported as well in the custom profiles.

MaMe keys: Rewind + P1 = Exit Game, Rewind + Menu = MaMe Configuration menu.

Setting [C] should only be used if your USB has the controllers swapped.
Setting [D] copies some slight changes to the CoinOPS theme settings and layouts to increase speed.
Setting [E] to bypass JoyToKey if using ALU MM file
Setting [F] to replace retroFE with the latest version (3/24/2020) from gitHub I compiled
Setting [G] Copy new custom CoinOPs executable to just load RetroFE and not load JoyToKey
Setting [H] Should only be used when copying files has issues. Such as 0 files copied or errors.
Setting [J] Opens Devices and Printers to so you can check if the ALU is showing up correctly.

[I] Add Mouse Mode to startup and run joystick mouse mode which allows you to use the ALU P1 and P2 controls to act like a mouse. Please be aware that this ALU OTG MM may throw a false positive on your virus scanner due to using MPRESS on the executable to make the executable smaller. This is the latest version (this will also check if running as admin, if not it will run as admin to be able to click on some other windows such as onscreenkeyboard).

A = Left Click 
B = Right Click
C = Middle Click (scrolling)

P1 A + Menu = Enable / Disable P1 MM
P2 A + Menu = Enable / Disable P2 MM

Rewind + P1 = Close App
Z + Menu = Open / Close x360ce 4.10 

*If you are using [H] This will run the takeown command allowing your account full access to the coinops folder and sub-folders. This make take some time if you have lot of add-on packs or the larger CoinOPS next file.
